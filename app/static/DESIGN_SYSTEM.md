# Screenboard Studio — design system

**For the agent working on this codebase: read this before writing any UI.**
Add to `CLAUDE.md`: `UI work must follow app/static/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md.`

This file is the contract. The app was redesigned in July 2026; markup written
against the old conventions will look wrong even if it "works". If a rule here
conflicts with surrounding code you find, this file wins — that code is v1
residue and should be brought forward.

---

## The two rules everything derives from

**1. Amber is a signal, not a decoration.** `--accent` marks exactly three
things: the current pipeline stage, the one primary action in view, and focus.
Nothing else. Not section titles, not IDs, not badges, not borders for emphasis.
The v1 failure was amber on every `h2`, every ID, and both borders and buttons —
used everywhere it pointed nowhere, and the one live action became unfindable.
Before you add amber, name which of the three things it is. If it isn't one of
them, use `--ink` or `--ink-dim`.

**2. Courier carries machine data.** Screenplays are typed in Courier, so the
app speaks the same hand. Spec IDs, statuses, counts, timestamps, roles, hashes,
sizes, file names, column headers → `var(--mono)`. Headings, labels, prose,
buttons → `var(--sans)` (Archivo). A reader should be able to tell data from
voice without reading a word. Never set body prose in Courier; never set an ID
in Archivo.

## Tokens

Use variables. Never hardcode a hex in new CSS.

```
surfaces   --bg #121417  --bg2 #15181b  --panel #1a1d21  --panel2 #21252a
           --field #0f1114   (inputs sit INSET, darker than everything)
lines      --line #2b3037    --line-soft #23272c
ink        --ink #eceef0     --ink-dim #9aa1a8    --ink-faint #6b7278
accent     --accent #e0a33f  --accent-ink #0b0c0e (text on amber)
status     --ok #6fae7a  --warn #e0a33f  --bad #cd6155  --hold #7d8fd0
type       --sans Archivo    --mono "Courier New"
radius     --radius 0px      (square. do not add rounding)
```

Surfaces layer `--bg` < `--bg2` < `--panel` < `--panel2`. Going deeper means
"more active/selected", never "more important".

Status colors report state only. `--ok` is not a "success accent" for
decoration; `--bad` is not a red you reach for because something is loud.

### Three ink tiers, and only three
`--ink` for primary content, `--ink-dim` for supporting, `--ink-faint` for
labels and metadata. Do not invent a fourth grey — a mid-tone between
`--ink-faint` and the surface will fail contrast on `--bg`. (This happened once
already with `#4f5459`.) The single exception is `#4a4d52` on disabled buttons,
where low contrast is the signal.

## Layout patterns

**Pipeline band.** `nav#nav` is the product's spine: numbered stages 01–04 in
work order, then `.nav-gap`, then off-pipeline tools (Research, Settings). A new
*stage* gets a number and joins the band in sequence. A new *tool* goes right of
the gap. Stage cells use `minmax(0,1fr)` tracks and their labels are
`white-space: nowrap` — a long label must be shortened, never allowed to inflate
its track.

**One lead per screen.** At most one `.panel.panel-lead` (amber left border,
`--panel2`) per view, and it holds the thing blocking the user. Everything else
is a plain `.panel`. Two leads = no lead.

**Main/side split.** Work goes left in `.dash-main` at generous width; counts,
standing rules, and history recede into `.dash-side`. Counts are not the point
of a screen — the next action is.

**Wizard steps.** `.panel.step[data-step="N"]` renders its number in the gutter
with a connecting rule. If you add or reorder steps, renumber `data-step` — it
is static markup, not generated.

**Ledger rows.** `.ledger-row` — every row *including the header* carries
`border-left: 2px solid transparent`. A state marker colors that border in. Never
add the border only to marked rows; it shifts columns 2px and destroys vertical
scanning.

## Copy

Prose was ~3:1 over interface by area in v1. Rules:

- One `p.hint` per panel, max. It is capped at `74ch` — respect that.
- A control's explanation goes in its `title` tooltip, not beside it. Never both.
- Constraints render as structure, not sentences. `CONTROLS face · hair · build`
  / `NOT costume · light · lens` in Courier beats a four-line paragraph.
- Every step or blocking state ends with the single next verb. If a screen has no
  verb, it isn't finished.
- Sentence case in prose; uppercase only for Courier labels and badges.

## Components

| Need | Use | Not |
|---|---|---|
| Primary action | `button.primary` (one per region) | amber on multiple buttons |
| Secondary | `button.ghost` | a second `.primary` |
| Destructive | `button.danger` | red fill |
| State | `.badge.APPROVED / .DRAFT / .REJECTED / .LOCKED` | colored text alone |
| Machine value | `<span class="mini">` + Courier child | Archivo |
| Section title | `.panel h2` (quiet Courier label) | amber headline |

`.badge.LOCKED` is deliberately grey: locked is a fact, not an action.

Rejected reference cards dim the **image only** (`.ref-card.REJECTED img`). Never
dim the card — the rejection reason is the entire payload of a rejected card.

---

## Sequence and gates

The product is strictly sequential: screenplay → bible → breakdown → lock →
panels → board. Gates must be **readable as state before they are hit**, never
discovered as an error toast. When you add a gated action:

1. Show the disabled control with `:disabled` styling (visible, not hidden).
2. State the unmet condition next to it, in Courier if it's a count.
3. Link to where it gets resolved.

"Only locked sheets generate" should be visible on the sheet, not a surprise on
the button.

## Adding a feature — checklist

- [ ] Does it belong to a stage, or is it a tool? That decides where it lives.
- [ ] Reused an existing class before writing a new one?
- [ ] Tokens only — no new hex, no new grey, no border-radius.
- [ ] Amber used zero or one time, and it's the primary action?
- [ ] Machine values in Courier, prose in Archivo?
- [ ] One `p.hint`; longer explanation moved to `title`?
- [ ] Screen still has exactly one obvious next verb?
- [ ] New grid tracks use `minmax(0,1fr)`?

---

## Do not

- Add a CSS framework, or Inter/Roboto.
- Add gradients, rounded cards, drop shadows for decoration, or emoji.
- Introduce a new accent color, or use a status color decoratively.
- Wrap content in more nested panels — depth was the v1 clutter mechanism.
- Rename existing CSS classes. `app.js` generates markup against these names;
  the stylesheet was written to preserve every one of them.
